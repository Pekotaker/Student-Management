Back-end code for database handling
 - models               :   define schemas of different database tables
 - params               :   link to the database.
 - routes               :   connect back-end and front-end, define POST and GET functions.
 - node_modules         :   just don't open it and forget that it exist, you'll be fine.
 - app.js               :   pretty much the equivalent of the main() function.
 - package(-lock).json  :   some info of the overall projects.
 - session.js           :   Handle authentication
 - userLayout.js        :   Handle user display layout
